title: Unexpected downtime of percival & pooch
mt_id: 28

percival &amp; pooch were unavailable due to yet unknown reasons. <strike>I suspect that there was a power loss in the rack.</strike><br /><br />Update: pooch is back, too.<br /><br />Update2: the DC seems to have fucked up the air-conditioning/cooling. See for yourself, the relevant System-Event-Log entries from pooch:<br />
